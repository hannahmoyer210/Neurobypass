Enrolled patients from both treatment arms are otherwise treated similarly after 24 hours, according to their medical needs. Standards of care management for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage published in the 2010 American Heart Association guidelines are incorporated in to the study protocol.

The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score measures of level of consciousness in eye, motor, and verbal components. At least one point is given in each category. The scale ranges from 3 to 15, with 3 indicating deep unconsciousness and 15 indicating consciousness is not impaired. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) quantifies neurologic deficits in 11 categories. Level of consciousness, horizontal eye movement, visual fields, facial palsy, movement in each limb, sensation, language & speech, and extinction or inattention on one side of the body are tested. Scores range from 0 to 42, with 0 indicating normal function and higher scores indicating greater deficit severity. Neurological status was checked per ICU standards through 24 hours, recommended as hourly GCS and full assessment every 2 hours. NIHSS assessment at baseline and 24 +/- 3 hours was pre-specified. Assessments were added for suspected neurological change. | Hypotension (abnormally low blood pressure) was the most likely adverse event that could be associated with the study treatment, and is the primary basis (risk) on which neurological deterioration or other untoward effects of the study treatment could occur. It is therefore examined as a numerically-measured occurrence in addition to monitoring patients closely for neurological deterioration or other symptoms. Hypotension, when named as an adverse event, was defined as the syndrome of low blood pressure with SBP < 85 mmHg. Instances of hypotension were to be avoided through close monitoring, and administration of fluid bolus for SBP < 110 mmHg. If hypotension did occur, it was to be reversed as quickly as possible through discontinuation of intravenous nicardipine and intravenous fluid administration, which can be accomplished readily in a variety of settings where patients with intracerebral hemorrhage are routinely housed during early hospitalization. | Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed by the site investigators for all patients, including for their potential relatedness to the study treatment. An Independent Oversight Committee (IOC) reviewed and adjudicated all adverse event data. The 72-hours-from-randomization time window was considered the most likely time frame during which treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events would be observed. Terminology from the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and severity criteria from the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE v. 4.03) were used as a basis for reporting adverse events. Serious adverse events are defined as being fatal, life-threatening, resulting in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization, resulting in disability or congenital anomaly, or requiring intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage and were required to be reported promptly. | The complete count of all subjects who experienced any serious adverse events throughout their participation in the trial was included in this tabulation. Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were assessed by the site investigators for all patients. Potential relatedness to the study treatment was a required reporting element for all adverse events but was not considered in this count.
